# photo-manager

Organize photos and videos with an advanced tagging system and geolocation.

## Photo Tagging
- Tag photos for easy categorization
- Color-code tags
- View which tags are used the most
- Rate photos and see which tags have the greatest influence on rating
- Add prerequisite, corequisite, and incompatible tags for advanced organization
- Advanced search by tags allows you to include and exclude tags from view, and search using multiple tags with AND or OR logic
- Group similar photos
- Add titles, descriptions, and dates to phoos
- Supports RAW photo formats
- Supports videos, and has an embedded video player

## Custom Mapping
- Define places with custom titles, notes, and icons
- Organize places with layers and set custom colors for the places in each layer
- Assign photos to places to search by location
- Geolocation is not written to the file, to avoid accidental privacy violations
- View a heatmap of where your photos are most commonly taken
- Draw on the map with lines and polygons

## Calendar View
